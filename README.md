# Happy thoughts Project

The assignment was to practice our React state skills by fetching messages from the Happy thoughts API and also create a form for posting new messages. And a function for liking messages.

### The Problem

I started out with planning which components I needed. Then I continued with fetching the data from the API. After that I created a form for posting new thoughts. And then finished with styling it. I still find it quite challenging to use CSS when I need to follow someone elses's design, so that was great practice. If I had more time I would go for the stretch goals.
